             <p>This is just an example of what can be done using HTML and CSS. This site is meant for testing various features and to get a feel for different things that can be done using these two languages. Not much to talk about. Just trying to burn some space here. I also want to try and make this site mobile friendly once I get to it. Might do some images and stuff. Might try to make the email forms work and do up some kind of photo gallery. All kinds of cool things to test!</p>
