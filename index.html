            <h2>Welcome to Sandbox!</h2>
            <div class="spacer100px"></div>
             <p>This is just an example of what can be done using HTML, CSS, and JS. This site was written 100% inside a text editor and no photo editing tools were used! This is 100% pure code. This site is meant for testing various features and to get a feel for different things that can be done using these languages. Not much to talk about. Just trying to burn some space here. I also want to try and make this site mobile friendly once I get to it. Might do some images and stuff. Might try to make the email forms work and do up some kind of photo gallery. All kinds of cool things to test!</p>

             <p>This is another paragraph to make this thing longer. I hope this is working!</p>

             <p>We hope you can enjoy our many great things we have to offer on this site. We have random pictures and blurbs of text and so much more. This is a demo site.</p>
             
             <p>Enjoy our demo site!</p>
